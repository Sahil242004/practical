Problem Statement:
1. Create table Customers with schema (ID, name, age, address, salary)
2. Create table Orders with Schema(O_ID, o_date, customer_id, amount)
3. Insert 5 records to each table keeping few customer ids common to both the tables
4. Perform the inner join on customers and orders table to enlist the id, name, amount and o_date
5. Perform the left outer join on customers and orders table to enlist the id, name, amount and o_date
6. Perform the right outer join on customers and orders table to enlist the id, name, amount and o_date
7. Perform the full outer join on customers and orders table to enlist the id, name, amount and o_date by using „union all‟ set operation
8. Perform the self join on customers table to enlist the pair of customers belonging to same address
9. Perform the Cross/ Cartesian join on customers and orders table to enlist the id, name, amount and o_date
10. Design the sub query with select statement for displaying all the details of the customers having salary greater than 20000
11. Create a backup table- „cust_bkp‟ of the table customers by using insert statement with the subquery
12. Update the salaries by 10% of all the customers(in customers table) having age greater than or equals to 24 by using sub query with update clause( by using backup table cust_bkp)
13. Delete all the customers having age greater than 26 by using delete clause with the subquery
